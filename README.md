# React + Vite

A username variable is hardcoded as 'grumpy19' on line 12 of Comments.jsx. A user must be signed in to post comments and to delete their own comments. If the user is not signed in, they can only read comments. To see this behaviour, comment out line 12.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
