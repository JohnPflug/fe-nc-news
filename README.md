## Project Description
### Introduction
NC News is a dynamic front-end project crafted with React.js, created as part of a full-stack web application during a JavaScript bootcamp. This project highlights the breadth of skills and knowledge gained throughout the boot-camp, including user interface development, state management, and seamless back-end integration. To explore the backend aspect of this project, check out the repository [be-nc-news](https://github.com/JohnPflug/be-nc-news)

### Features
The application allows users to view, comment on, and vote for articles. It includes features such as user authentication, real-time updates, and a responsive design.

### Technologies Used
Built using React.js, React Bootstrap, Bootstrap, and Axios for the front-end, with Vite as the build tool.

### Challenges and Learning
One of the challenges was handling state management efficiently. Reactâ€™s Context API was used to manage user information.

### Future Features
Upcoming updates will introduce functionality for uploading articles and implementing pagination for easier navigation through articles.

**Special Functionality**:
   - **User Authentication**: In order to post comments or delete one's own comments, a user needs to be signed into the application. 'grumpy19' is passed as the username state on line 6 of contexts/UserContext.jsx and is used as a React Context value.

   If this string is removed (useState()) or replaced with a non-existent username, the user will be able to read the articles but not vote on them. Moreover, while they will be able to read the comments on each article, they will not be able to post comments, nor delete their own.
